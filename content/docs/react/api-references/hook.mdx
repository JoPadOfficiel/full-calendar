description: Access and control your stepper with the useStepper hook
---

The `useStepper` hook provides methods to interact with and render your methods. It can be used with or without the [`Scoped`](./scoped) component.

The hook accepts an optional configuration object with the following properties:

- `initialStep` The ID of the initial step to display
- `initialMetadata` The initial metadata to set for the steps

## Usage

```tsx twoslash

```

## Rendering Methods

### when

The when method allows rendering content conditionally based on the current step.
It can take an id of a step (either a string or an array of a step ID followed by booleans)
and a whenFn (the function to execute if the step matches). Additionally, you can provide
an optional elseFn (the function to execute if the step does not match).

```tsx twoslash
```

You can define more complex conditions that not only depend on the current step's ID
but also on additional boolean values. This allows for multi-condition logic where each
boolean must evaluate to true for the step to match. The boolean values can represent
different state conditions or external factors that affect the step's visibility or behavior.

<Callout type="info">
  The first element of the array is the step ID, the following elements are the
  boolean values.
</Callout>

```tsx twoslash
import * as React from "react";
const MyStepperComponent = () => {

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      Hello
    </React.Fragment>
  );
};
```

### switch

The switch method allows you to render content based on the current step's ID,
similar to a switch-case structure. This method provides a cleaner and more scalable
way to handle different step-specific rendering logic, making it ideal for scenarios
where you need to differentiate the UI depending on the current step without writing
multiple when conditions.

```tsx twoslash
```

### match

The match method allows you to render content based on an external state,
such as a value fetched from a server or any dynamic state in your application.
This provides flexibility for rendering content that is tied not only to the
current step in the stepper but also to any other state outside the stepper's
context, such as user actions, data from an API, or global application state.

```tsx twoslash
```

<Callout type="info">
  `match` allows state-based control from client or server, useful for
  frameworks like Remix with server-side state management.
</Callout>

## Before/after functions

While the API provides specific functions to move to the previous or next step, there are situations such as form validations where we want to execute actions before or after we move to the previous or next step.

That is why there are the following functions:

- `beforeNext`
- `afterNext`
- `beforePrev`
- `afterPrev`
- `beforeGoTo`
- `afterGoTo`

### beforeNext

The `beforeNext` function allows you to execute a function before moving to the next step.
It returns a promise that resolves to a boolean value. If the promise resolves to true,
the stepper will move to the next step. If the promise resolves to false, the stepper
will not move to the next step.

In case you don't need a promise, you can use the `beforeNext` returning a boolean value.
