description: Using the Scoped component to share stepper state across child components
---

The `Scoped` component acts as a provider, allowing you to synchronize stepper state via `useStepper` across child components.

## Basic Usage

```tsx twoslash

```

<Callout title="When to use Scoped">
  Use `Scoped` only when child components need access to stepper state.
  Otherwise, use the hook directly in your component.
</Callout>

| --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- |
| initialStep     | `string`                   | ID of the initial step to display.    | No       |

| children        | `React.ReactNode`          | Content to render inside the stepper. | Yes      |

## Nested Scopes

You can nest multiple scopes for more complex stepper hierarchies:

```tsx

```

This structure allows for independent control of global and local stepper states.
