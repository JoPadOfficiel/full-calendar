## Core Concepts

The calendar application is built around a few key principles that ensure a seamless, intuitive, and flexible user experience. These concepts define how the application organizes and presents data, handles user interactions, and supports customization.

### Event-Centric Design

Events are the heart of the calendar application, enabling users to create, manage, and visualize their schedules effectively. This concept focuses on:

- **Flexible Event Management**: Users can create, edit, and delete events with ease, with support for recurring events and detailed metadata (e.g., title, description, time, and attendees).
- **Drag & Drop and Resizing**: Events can be moved across dates or time slots and resized in day/week views, providing an intuitive way to adjust schedules.
- **Color Coding**: Events can be assigned distinct colors for quick identification, enhancing organization and visual clarity.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Scheduling meetings or appointments
- Planning personal or team tasks
- Tracking deadlines or milestones
- Organizing recurring events like weekly check-ins

### Multi-View Navigation

The calendar supports multiple views (Day, Week, Month, Year, Agenda) to cater to different user needs, ensuring flexibility in how schedules are visualized and managed. This concept includes:

- **Dynamic View Switching**: Seamlessly switch between views to focus on specific timeframes or get a broader overview.
- **Context-Aware Interactions**: Each view provides tailored interactions, such as resizing events in day/week views or summarizing events in the agenda view.
- **Responsive Layouts**: Views adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Reviewing daily tasks in the Day view
- Planning weekly schedules in the Week view
- Getting a high-level overview in the Month or Year view
- Summarizing upcoming events in the Agenda view

### Interactive and Customizable UI

The application prioritizes a modern, user-friendly interface that enhances interactivity and personalization. Key aspects include:

- **ShadCN UI Components**: Built with reusable, customizable components for a consistent and polished look.
- **Dark Mode and Time Format Options**: Users can toggle between dark and light modes or choose between 24-hour and 12-hour time formats for a personalized experience.
- **Multi-User Support**: Filter events by user to support collaborative environments, such as team scheduling or shared calendars.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Customizing the interface for personal or team preferences
- Collaborating on shared calendars in multi-user environments
- Ensuring accessibility across devices with responsive design
- Enhancing usability with dark mode or preferred time formats
